            Our interface design falls into the category of screens. Our system is a multi-touch-screen display that imitates a mirror, and would typically be found within a bedroom, dressing room, walk-in closet, or any other room where people dress. 
          </p>
          <p>
           The concept behind the system is that while functioning as a mirror, the screen can also provide the user the ability to try on clothes, makeup, hairstyles etc. It displays relevant information for the user, such as weather, current date of the week. It can also connect to the user's smartphone via wifi, and display the user's calendar appointments for the day.

            The upper-right hand corner of the mirror displays the date and day of the week, as well as the current temperature, to allow the user to plan their outfit. Clicking on the date or time will open up a larger calendar widget, and clicking on the weather section will expand a larger content area with detailed weather information for the day and week. In the upper-left hand corner, there is a quarter-pie menu with a list of widgets. In order to scroll through the widget icons, the user swipes in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. Clicking on any of these icons will launch its respective application.
