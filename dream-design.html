            Our interface design falls into the category of screens. Our system is a multi-touch-screen displaying input from a built in high definition camera. The system is meant to imitate a mirror, and would typically be found within a bedroom, dressing room, walk-in closet, or any other room where people dress, where a mirror would normally be found. 
          </p>
          <p>
           The concept behind the system is that while functioning as a mirror, the screen can also provide the user the ability to virtually try on clothes, makeup, hairstyles etc via screen overlays. It also displays relevant information for the user, such as the weather and the current date of the week. It can also connect to the user's smartphone via Wi-Fi, and display the user's calendar appointments for the day, All of these features are aimed at helping the user plan their outfit for the day as efficiently as possible.

            Though the selling point of the magic mirror is a touch interactive mirror, some settings have been made physical for easy accessibility, so as to not crowd the screen. As such on the side of mirror their is a 5 button panel with a wifi indicator and fingerprint scanner. It is centered vertically on the mirror in order to cater to most people’s heights. The order from top down is as follows: sound up button, sound down button, mute button, settings button, wifi indicator, fingerprint scanner, power button. The wifi indicator lights up to tell the user if the system is connected to the internet or not. The fingerprint scanner is to give the user another way to log onto their account if facial recognition fails.

          <p>The user can use the screen interface with touch interaction to control all actions on screen. Additionally, they can navigate the system through gestures via body-tracking or voice commands through natural language. The base screen is just a “reflection” (created by integrated 4k hd camera). On top of this there will be all active widgets. If the placement of widgets has not been customized then the all widgets - except date & time and weather - will be in a quarter circle in the top left corner of the screen, in the form of a rotating pi menu. The Date & Time widgets along with the weather widget will be displayed in the top right corner of the screen. The widgets can be clicked on, held down, and dragged. If you click on a widget then it will launch the application, and if you hold down and drag then the widget will move to where you drag and release it, if you hold down on it without dragging then options will appear around it with deactive being a default option for all widgets.  
          </p>
          <p>
            All widgets can be deactivated by clicking the deactivate menu in their options menu or unmarking them in the settings menu.The settings menu can be accessed by the settings widget(which can be deactivated) or the settings button. When you open the settings menu, the screen will fade and a list will pop up. On top of the list will be two adjustment bars, one for sound and the other for screen brightness. The list will include every widget with a square box next to it. Active widgets will have their box checked while deactivated widgets will have their box unmarked. Users can toggle between active and deactive by clicking the widget’s name or the box next to it. To exit the settings menu the user can click anywhere on the screen not covered by the menu or press the settings button.

           Expanding on the existing functionality of a mirror, this new enhanced Magic Mirror will act in the same way as one expects of a traditional mirror. The mirror is an essential tool used everyday from the moment a person gets out of bed. It aids us in ways that are not given a second thought. Mirrors indirectly help us clean our teeth, do our hair, and get dressed. Getting dressed can sometimes be a hassle if one cannot decide what to wear. For some people, picking out an outfit sometimes results in a bedroom or closet floor covered in clothes. Although not everyone suffers with this problem, wouldn’t it be nice if there were a tool that could help speed up this process? In the 90’s movie Clueless, the main character, Cher Horowitz uses a computer to pick and choose her outfits. The computer even goes so far as to tell Cher whether a top and bottom yield a matching outfit. Although the latter is something of subjective human reasoning and opinion that computers cannot mimic, the idea is executable in some way. One of the applications central to this mirror is the ability to upload and organize one’s closet, an app called OOTD. The acronym stands for “outfit of the day”. In this application, users can stand in front of the mirror and swipe throught the air in left or right motions to navigate through the clothes in their wardrobe. Additionally, they can utilize voice commands of "next" and "previous", in a form of natural language interaction. Through the use of motion tracking like that seen in the Microsoft Kinect, the clothes will overlay onto the body of the person, like a virtual dressing room but without the hassle of actually changing. Left and right arrows on the mirror screen will allow the user to physically tap the mirror to “change clothes” and act as visual navigation indicators. Direct manipulation is the form of interaction displayed here to since this function may also be carried out by physically motioning or waving one’s arms left or right to indicate “next” or “previous”. The user may also directly touch the screen to drag the clothes being “tried on” off of his or her body. Once an outfit is decided on, the user can easily take the items out of his or her closet and get dressed without a tornado of clothes plundering through the room. Another helpful tool provided by OOTD is closet organization, allowing the user to sort and view their clothes based off general categories like dresses, tops, bottoms, and outerwear. The interaction style being utilized here is menu selection. This side menu will contain a list of categories with the respective clothing items sorted into each one.

           When the OOTD app is first accessed, the pie menu in the top left corner will fade away and the interface that the user will see is depicted in the left image above. The title “OOTD” will be present only momentarily to provide feedback to the user that this application has started. The side menu is positioned on the right side of the mirror to allow the user to view the clothes stored in each category and “try on” each item by swiping left and right. The default function of this application will allow users to try on clothes preselected by the system based off the day’s weather. For instance, on a hot summer day, the user will be browsing through lightweight tops, shorts, skirts, and dresses in contrast to winter days where the options will be pants, sweaters, and coats. This filter employs the first principle of anticipation in order to increase efficiency when it comes to deciding on the day’s outfit.  By limiting the user’s options to what is reasonable to wear based off the weather, anticipating the type of outfit that will be chosen results in higher levels of efficiency and satisfaction. Less navigation will be required of the user and only relevant information is presented so that the program can be readily incorporated into one’s daily routine. In doing so, a user does not waste time scrolling through options that they have already mentally disqualified. For instance, someone would not be considering sun dresses as a possible outfit when it is snowing outside. The simplicity of this application makes this interface so easy to use that it could be utilized outside of the private home. Retailers could employ this interface to allow customers to “try on” on their clothes to get an idea of what something may look like. Many times long dressing room lines or the idea of having to dress and undress results in time and money wasted on unflattering clothes. Of course, the illusion in the Magic Mirror is not as accurate as trying on the physical item but it does allow the customer to envision what it may look like. This would eliminate the hassle of trying on multiple items and save time and money.

          <p>
            The magic mirror responds to a variety of voice commands. It has been programmed with speech-recognition software comparable to that of Xbox Kinect and Apple's Siri.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user can speak in natural language to the mirror, using commands to open apps, or to ask the mirror to read information from the user's smartphone out loud. The mirror responds, also in natural language, displaying any relevant information on the screen or displaying it out loud, depending on the user's request. If the mirror responds with audio, lights around the edges of the screen serve as visual feedback to notify the user that there is audio output. The following represents a scenario in which the user wishes to hear their scheduled appointments for the day, and the mirror responds verbally, reading the events from the user's smartphone via a wi-fi connection.

          <p>
            The mirror’s sticky note interface allows the user to post virtual sticky notes of various sizes to the mirror screen. The way the sticky note interface works is that their is one main sticky note that has similar binding to a memopad or notepad on top of it. When the user clicks on it, it assumes that you want to create a new sticky note and opens the sticky note editor. When the user holds down on it, the usual widget menu interface appears and the user will be presented five options: New Sticky, Delete All, Hide All, Show All, and of course the standard deactivate widget button. When the user selects the ‘New Sticky’ button the mirror opens the sticky note editor. A big yellow sticky note with a save button in the bottom right corner appears on the screen and the rest of the screen fades out. The user is then presented a qwerty keyboard below the sticky to type in their entry. As text reaches the end of the sticky, the sticky will scroll down creating more room. The user will of course be able to scroll up and down by flicking the sticky note with their hand. 
          </p>
          <p>
           Once they click the save button the big sticky note will disappear and the mirror will fade in. Next to the main sticky note (to the right if there is not enough room on the left side of the screen and on the left every other time) a new sticky note widget will appear. The new sticky will look just like the main sticky without the notepad binding on top and will behave like a regular widget except it will not have the ability to be deactivated. When you click on it, it will bring up the sticky note editor and the text inside of it. When you hold down on it, it will give you the options to edit, delete, or hide it. Thanks to this simple and intuitive system the sticky note interface has strength in learnability and memorability.

            The system uses anticipation throughout to aid user efficiency. Instead of having to physically turn on the mirror, it utilizes motion-detection, to anticipate the user entering the room and potentially using the mirror. The mirror will automatically turn on. Normally, when approaching a mirror, the mental model in the user’s head is that no further action is required. The user expects the mirror to reflect whatever is in front of it, and this characteristic is replicated in our mirror, to maintain consistency with a traditional mirror. Our mirror automatically turns on via motion sensing when someone enters the room, so that it immediately starts reflecting whatever is in front of it. Otherwise, when no motion is detected, as in when someone leaves the room, it will automatically enter a “power-save-mode” to conserve energy, and the display will turn off. In the Outfit of The Day application, the system provides recommendations based on what it anticipates the user will be most comfortable in, based on the weather forecast.

          <p>
            The system provides feedback in cases where the internal state must transition, to assure the user that it is responding to user input. As previously noted, the system will provide visual feedback in the form of flashing lights around the edges of the mirror when speaking back to the user. This ensures that feedback is delivered to the user in the case the sound on their mirror has been muted. They will know that the system responded, but they just did not hear the response because the sound was off. Additionally, when transitioning between applications, the system will notify the user via on-screen text and auditory responses. When pressing the capacitative buttons on the side of the mirror, they will give tactile feedback in the form of vibrations, indicating that the button press has been received by the system.

          <p>
            We project that our system will perform the most strongly in the category of efficiency. We have designed it to require minimal effort on the part of the user, with each task requiring zero to no more than a few touches or voice commands. Our aforementioned efforts at integration of anticipation specifically minimize the number of touches required. Additionally there are no complex menus to navigate through, as all of the functionality of the mirror can be accessed from the pie menu in the upper right hand corner. Logging in and out of the system is done automatically, with the facial recognition feature. To catch errors that might occur with the facial recognition technology, a thumb print scanner on the side panel provides a secondary alternative to login.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the small number of possible input actions the user perform, and consistency across our widgets, the magic mirror also yields itself to strong learnability and memorability metrics. Considering it is a device that will be used daily the actions involved will become second nature increasing memorability further.
