            Our interface design falls into the category of screens. Our system is a multi-touch-screen display that imitates a mirror, and would typically be found within a bedroom, dressing room, walk-in closet, or any other room where people dress. 
          </p>
          <p>
           The concept behind the system is that while functioning as a mirror, the screen can also provide the user the ability to try on clothes, makeup, hairstyles etc. It displays relevant information for the user, such as the weather and the current date of the week. It can also connect to the user's smartphone via wifi, and display the user's calendar appointments for the day.

            The upper-right hand corner of the mirror displays the date and day of the week, as well as the current temperature, to allow the user to plan their outfit. Clicking on the date or time will open up a larger calendar widget, and clicking on the weather section will expand a larger content area with detailed weather information for the day and week. In the upper-left hand corner, there is a quarter-pie menu with a list of widgets. In order to scroll through the widget icons, the user swipes in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. Clicking on any of these icons will launch its respective application.

          <p>
            The magic mirror responds to a variety of voice commands. It has been programmed with speech-recognition software comparable to that of Xbox Kinect, of Apple's Siri.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user can speak in natural language to the mirror, using commands to open apps, or to ask the mirror to read information from the user's smartphone out loud. The mirror responds, also in natural language, displaying any relevant information on the screen or displaying it out loud, depending on the user's request. If the mirror responds with audio, lights around the edges of the screen serve as visual feedback to notify the user that there is audio output. The following represents a scenario in which the user wishes to hear their scheduled appointments for the day, and the mirror responds verbally, reading the events from the user's smartphone via a wi-fi connection.

          <p>
            The mirror’s sticky note interface allows the user to post sticky notes of various sizes to the mirror screen. The way the sticky note interface works is that their is one main sticky note that has similar binding to a memopad or notepad on top of it. When the user clicks on it, it assumes that you want to create a new sticky note and opens the sticky note editor. When the user holds down on it, the usual widget menu interface appears and the user will be presented five options: New Sticky, Delete All, Hide All, Show All, and of course the standard deactivate widget button. When the user selects the ‘New Sticky’ button the mirror opens the sticky note editor. A big yellow sticky note with a save button in the bottom right corner appears on the screen and the rest of the screen fades out. The user is then presented a qwerty keyboard below the sticky to type in their entry. As text reaches the end of the sticky, the sticky will scroll down creating new room. The user will of course be able to scroll up and down by flicking the sticky note with their hand. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Once they click the save button the big sticky note will disappear and the mirror will fade in. Next to the main sticky note ( to the right if there is not enough room on the left side of the screen and on the left every other time ) a new sticky note widget will appear. The new sticky will look just like the main sticky without the notepad binding on top and will behave like a regular widget. When you click on it, it will bring up the sticky note editor and the text inside of it. When you hold down on it, it will give you the options to edit, delete, and hide it.
