            Our interface design falls into the category of screens. Our system is a multi-touch-screen display with a built in high definition camera,  that imitates a mirror, and would typically be found within a bedroom, dressing room, walk-in closet, or any other room where people dress, where a mirror would normally be found. 
          </p>
          <p>
           The concept behind the system is that while functioning as a mirror, the screen can also provide the user the ability to try on clothes, makeup, hairstyles etc. It displays relevant information for the user, such as the weather and the current date of the week. It can also connect to the user's smartphone via Wi-Fi, and display the user's calendar appointments for the day, helping the user plan their outfit as quickly as possible.

            Though the selling point of the magic mirror is a touch interactive mirror, some settings should be made physical for easy accessibility that does not crowd the screen. As such on the side of mirror their is a 5 button panel. It is be centered in order to submit to most heights. The buttons are in order of importance, with the least important on the top, and the most important at the bottom as you can’t be too tall to reach the buttons, but you can be too short. The order from top down are as follows: sound up, sound down, mute, settings, on/off. 
          </p>
          <p>The user can use the screen interface with touch interaction to control all actions on screen. Additionally, they can navigate the system through gestures via body-tracking. The base screen is just a “reflection” (created by attached 4k hd camera). On top of this there will be all active widgets. If the placement of widgets has not been customized then the all widgets - except date & time and weather - will be in a quarter circle in the top left corner of the screen, in the form of a rotating pi menu. The Date & Time widget along with the weather widget will be displayed in the top right corner of the screen. The widgets can be clicked on, held down, and dragged. If you click on a widget then it wil launch the application, and if you hold down and drag then the widget will move to where you drag and release it, if you hold down on it without dragging then options will appear around it with deactive being a default option. 
          </p>
          <p>
            All widgets can be deactivated by clicking the deactivate menu in their options menu or unmarking them in the settings menu. The settings menu can be accessed by the settings widget(which can be deactivated) or the settings button. When you open the settings menu, the screen will fade and a list will pop up. On top of the list will be two adjustment bars, one for sound and the other for screen brightness. The list will include every widget with a square box next to it. Active widgets will have their box checked while deactivated widgets will have their box empty. You can toggle the widgets status by clicking on their name or the box. To exit the menu, simply click on the part of the screen not covered by the list or click the settings button.

          <p>
            Expanding on the existing functionality of a mirror, this new enhanced Magic Mirror will act in the same way as one expects of a traditional mirror. The mirror is an essential tool used everyday from the moment we get out of bed. It aids us in ways that are not given a second thought. Mirrors indirectly help us clean our teeth, do our hair, and get dress. Getting dressed can sometimes be a hassle if one cannot decide what to wear. For some people, picking out an outfit sometimes results in a bedroom or closet floor covered in clothes. Although not everyone suffers with this problem, wouldn’t it be nice if there were a tool that could help speed up this process? In the 90’s movie Clueless, the main character, Cher Horowitz uses a computer to pick and choose her outfits. The computer even goes so far as to tell Cher whether a top and bottom yield a matching outfit. Although the latter is something of subjective human reasoning and opinion that computers cannot mimic, the idea is executable in some way. One of the applications central to this mirror is the ability to upload and organize one’s closet, an app called #OOTD. The acronym stands for “outfit of the day”. In this application, users will be able to stand in front of the mirror and swipe left or right to navigate through the clothes in their wardrobe. Through the use of motion tracking like seen in the Microsoft Kinect, the clothes will map onto the body of the person, like a virtual dressing room but without the hassle of actually changing. Left and right arrows on the mirror screen will allow the user to physically tap the mirror to “change clothes”. This function may also be carried out by physically motioning or waving one’s arms left or right to indicate “next” or “previous”. Once an outfit is decided on, the user can easily take the items out of his or her closet and get dressed without a tornado of clothes plundering through the room. Another helpful tool provided by OOTD is closet organization, allowing the user to sort and view their clothes based off general categories like dresses, tops, bottoms, and outerwear. 
          </p>
          <p>
            When the OOTD widget is first accessed, the pie menu in the top left corner will fade away and the interface that the user will see is depicted in [REF IMAGE #]. The title “#OOTD” will be present only momentarily to provide feedback to the user that this application has started. Tabs on the right side of the mirror will allow the user to view the clothes stored in each category and “try on” each item by swiping left and right. The default function of this application will allow users to try on clothes preselected by the system based off the day’s weather. For instance, on a hot summer day, the user will be browsing through lightweight tops, shorts, skirts, and dresses in contrast to winter days where the options will be pants, sweaters, and coats. This filter helps anticipate the user’s outfit decision resulting in higher levels of efficiency and satisfaction. Less navigation will be required of the user and only relevant information is presented. Thus, a user does not waste time scrolling through different sun dresses when it is snowing outside and vice versa.

          <h3 id = "voice-commands">Voice Commands</h3>
          <p>
            The magic mirror responds to a variety of voice commands. It has been programmed with speech-recognition software comparable to that of Xbox Kinect and Apple's Siri.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user can speak in natural language to the mirror, using commands to open apps, or to ask the mirror to read information from the user's smartphone out loud. The mirror responds, also in natural language, displaying any relevant information on the screen or displaying it out loud, depending on the user's request. If the mirror responds with audio, lights around the edges of the screen serve as visual feedback to notify the user that there is audio output. The following represents a scenario in which the user wishes to hear their scheduled appointments for the day, and the mirror responds verbally, reading the events from the user's smartphone via a wi-fi connection.

          <h3 id = "sticky-notes"> Sticky Notes</h3>
          <p>
            The mirror’s sticky note interface allows the user to post sticky notes of various sizes to the mirror screen. The way the sticky note interface works is that their is one main sticky note that has similar binding to a memopad or notepad on top of it. When the user clicks on it, it assumes that you want to create a new sticky note and opens the sticky note editor. When the user holds down on it, the usual widget menu interface appears and the user will be presented five options: New Sticky, Delete All, Hide All, Show All, and of course the standard deactivate widget button. When the user selects the ‘New Sticky’ button the mirror opens the sticky note editor. A big yellow sticky note with a save button in the bottom right corner appears on the screen and the rest of the screen fades out. The user is then presented a qwerty keyboard below the sticky to type in their entry. As text reaches the end of the sticky, the sticky will scroll down creating new room. The user will of course be able to scroll up and down by flicking the sticky note with their hand. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Once they click the save button the big sticky note will disappear and the mirror will fade in. Next to the main sticky note (to the right if there is not enough room on the left side of the screen and on the left every other time) a new sticky note widget will appear. The new sticky will look just like the main sticky without the notepad binding on top and will behave like a regular widget except it will not have the ability to be deactivated. When you click on it, it will bring up the sticky note editor and the text inside of it. When you hold down on it, it will give you the options to edit, delete, and hide it.

          <h3>Anticipation</h3>
          <p>
            The system uses anticipation to strongly aid user efficiency. Instead of having to physically turn on the mirror, it utilizes motion-detection, to anticipate the user entering the room and potentially using the mirror, and subsequently, turn the display on. Normally, when approaching a mirror, the mental model in the user’s head is that no further action is required. The user expects the mirror to reflect whatever is in front of it, and this characteristic is replicated in our mirror, to maintain consistency with a traditional mirror. Our mirror automatically turns on via motion sensing when someone enters the room, so that it immediately starts reflecting whatever is in front of it. Otherwise, when no motion is detected, as in when someone leaves the room, it will automatically enter a “power-save-mode” to conserve energy.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class = "row">
        <div class = "col col-md-9 col-lg-9">
          <h1 id = "metric-projections">Metric Projections</h1>
          <p>
            We project that our system will perform the most strongly in the category of efficiency. We have designed it to require minimal effort on the part of the user, with each touch taking no more than a few tasks.  Our aforementioned integration of anticipation minimizes the numner of touches required. Additionally there are no complex menus to navigate through, as all of the functionality of the mirror can be accessed from the pi menu in the upper right hand corner. Logging in and out of the system is done automatically, with the facial recognition feature.
